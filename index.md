This is my home page! My name is Brian and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120
* Lab 11
    Lab 11, part 1 was one of my favorate labs because it was introducing
    me to classes in a fun way. We made a Pizza class where we stored the
    ID, Price, size, and calories. Prior to this, I had little experience
    with Classes so this was great practice. I used the things I learned
    in some of my personal projects.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was another great one. This was the one we did where we
    calculated the score in black jack. I liked it because it gave me an
    idea to make a playable version of Black Jack. Outside of class, I
    used c++ to write a file that allows you to play black jack against
    the computer. you were dealt cards and you can draw cards at random.
    At the time, I didn't know much c++ so many parts are written poorly,
    but if I were to write another program, I'd bet I could vastly improve
    the efficiency.

* Lab 12
    Lab 12, part 1 was a fun one. The animation was nice. It would gradualy
    change colors and make a gif out of the images. I have no doubt that I
    will be messing around with Magick again in the future on my own.
